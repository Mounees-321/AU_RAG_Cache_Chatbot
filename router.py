router.py — Phase 5: Agentic Routing Layer (now cache-aware)

This is the "agentic" part of the system: after trying to answer from the
knowledge base, the agent decides whether that answer is trustworthy, and
if not, autonomously falls back to a live web search instead of just
returning a bad or empty answer.

Phase 9 — Semantic Caching:
    Before ANY of that happens, route_and_answer() checks the semantic
    cache (semantic_cache.py, backed by Redis + RedisVL) for a previously
    answered, semantically similar question:

        User Query -> semantic_cache.check()
            HIT  -> return the cached answer immediately. The vector
                    store, cross-encoder, and Groq are never called —
                    this is a genuine full-pipeline bypass, not just a
                    skipped LLM call.
            MISS -> run the existing KB -> (search fallback) pipeline
                    exactly as before, then store the final answer in
                    the cache for next time.

    The cache fails open: if Redis is unreachable or disabled, check()
    always returns None and store() is a no-op, so the KB/search/LLM
    pipeline below is completely unaffected — this file's core logic is
    otherwise unchanged from the pre-caching version.

Decision signal used for KB vs. search:
    generator.py's system prompt instructs the LLM to output exactly
    INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT when the retrieved chunks don't answer the
    question. That's the trigger checked here — no extra LLM call needed
    for the routing decision itself, which keeps this fast and cheap.

Usage:
    python router.py --query "What courses does the IT department offer?"
    python router.py --query "What is the weather in Chennai today?"   (forces search fallback)

Requires:
    GROQ_API_KEY in .env (see generator.py)
    Optional: REDIS_URL / SEMANTIC_CACHE_* in .env (see semantic_cache.py)
